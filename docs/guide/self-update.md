# Updating Mago

Keeping **Mago** up-to-date is simple. We provide a built-in command to handle the entire update process for you, ensuring you always have the latest features and performance improvements.

### The `self-update` Command

To update Mago to the latest version, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
mago self-update
```

This command will:

1.  Check for the latest version of Mago.
2.  Download the new version if it's available.
3.  Replace the current binary with the updated one.

It's the easiest and recommended way to stay current.

### Verifying the Update

After the update process completes, you can verify that you have the latest version by running:

```bash
mago --version
```
